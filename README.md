1.1	PROBLEM STATEMENT

Problem:	The restaurant management team faces
challenges in harnessing the potential of their data to make informed decisions and streamline operations. Key areas of concern include:

Demand Forecasting: Difficulty in accurately predicting customer demand for different menu items, leading to overstocking or stock-outs, which affects both costs and customer satisfaction.

Menu Optimization: Determining which menu items are the most popular, profitable, or in need of improvement based on sales data, customer feedback, and other relevant metrics.

Staff Scheduling: Efficiently scheduling staff members based on anticipated demand patterns, peak hours, and labor costs to minimize over staffing or under staffing situations.
 
Customer Satisfaction: Analyzing feedback from various sources such as online reviews, surveys, and social media to identify areas for improvement and enhance the overall dining experience.

Inventory Management: Managing inventory levels effectively to minimize waste, reduce carrying costs, and ensure the availability of ingredients for popular dishes.
